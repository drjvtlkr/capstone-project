# capstone-project


I startyed this project sometime ago and today, I have finished working in this.

I have made many mistakes during this project. But I have improved my understanding by doing  them and improving upon them. Therefore more learned than before.

I have kept some mistakes as they are in the code base by commenting them, for me to look back at it in time to keep learning from my mistakes. and to measure my output in comiing days

Happy Learning
